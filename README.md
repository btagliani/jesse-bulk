# Jesse Bulk Backtest

A powerful tool for bulk backtesting Jesse trading strategies, fully compatible with the latest Jesse framework that uses Optuna for optimization. Run thousands of backtests in parallel to validate your strategies across different parameters and time periods.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Commands

**`jesse-bulk pick [db_path]`**  
Loads optimization results from Optuna SQLite database files. Removes duplicates and filters results according to your configuration criteria.

**`jesse-bulk refine [strategy] [db_path]`**  
Runs backtests with specific DNAs from Optuna optimization results. Perfect for validating optimized parameters across your configured timeframes and symbols.

**`jesse-bulk bulk [strategy]`**  
Runs basic backtests according to your configuration (symbols, timeframes, timespans) without specific hyperparameters. Uses default strategy parameters.

**`jesse-bulk refine-best [db_path] --top-n N --runs-per-dna R`**  
üÜï Tests the top N performing DNAs with R random time periods each. Ideal for robustness testing of your best strategies. Supports multiple selection presets (conservative, aggressive, balanced, robust) or test all presets with `--all-presets`.

**`jesse-bulk hall-of-fame [strategy] --top-n N --runs-per-dna R`**  
üÜï Tests the best DNAs from your Hall of Fame (persistent storage of top performers). Awards wins based on composite performance scoring.

**`jesse-bulk leaderboard --min-wins 1`**  
üÜï Shows the Hall of Fame leaderboard ranked by total wins. DNAs earn wins by consistently performing well across different market conditions.

**`jesse-bulk prune-hall-of-fame --min-success-rate 80 --confirm`**  
üÜï Removes underperforming DNAs from Hall of Fame based on test results. Use --confirm to actually delete (otherwise dry run).

**`jesse-bulk create-config`**  
Creates a `bulk_config.yml` template file in your project directory.

- **Date Ranges**: For `refine-best`, random start dates are generated within the specified constraints

# üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Install from git
pip install git+https://github.com/btagliani/jesse-bulk.git

# Navigate to your Jesse project directory
cd /path/to/your/jesse-project

# Create the configuration file
jesse-bulk create-config

# Edit the created bulk_config.yml file to match your strategy and preferences
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create and configure bulk_config.yml
jesse-bulk create-config

# Step 2: Filter optimization results (optional)
jesse-bulk pick storage/temp/optuna/optuna_study.db

# Step 3: Run bulk backtests with optimized parameters
jesse-bulk refine YourStrategy storage/temp/optuna/optuna_study.db

# Step 4: Test top performers with random time periods
jesse-bulk refine-best storage/temp/optuna/optuna_study.db --top-n 10 --runs-per-dna 5
```

### 2. Advanced Workflow: refine-best ‚Üí hall-of-fame ‚Üí leaderboard

This workflow demonstrates the full DNA selection and tracking system:

```bash
# Step 1: Find the best DNAs using advanced selection presets
# Test all presets to find the "king DNA"
jesse-bulk refine-best storage/temp/optuna/optuna_study.db --all-presets --top-n 5 --runs-per-dna 10

# Output: Finds top performers across conservative, aggressive, balanced, and robust selection methods
# The best DNAs are automatically added to the Hall of Fame

# Step 2: Test Hall of Fame DNAs across different market conditions
# This awards "wins" to DNAs that consistently perform well
jesse-bulk hall-of-fame --top-n 10 --runs-per-dna 10 --min-trades 20

# Output: Tests stored DNAs and awards wins based on composite scoring:
# - 50% Success Rate (avoiding bankruptcy is critical)
# - 20% Average Profit
# - 15% Average Sharpe Ratio
# - 10% Average Finishing Balance
# - 5% Minimum Balance

# Step 3: View the leaderboard to see which DNAs consistently win
jesse-bulk leaderboard

# Output shows:
# üèÜ HALL OF FAME LEADERBOARD
# Rank  DNA          Wins   Avg Score  Total Score  Strategy
# 1     ...0725b7a2  3      85.2       255.6        Rainmaker
# 2     ...90a748d0  2      78.5       157.0        Rainmaker

# Step 4: Clean up underperformers (optional)
# Remove DNAs that don't meet performance criteria
jesse-bulk prune-hall-of-fame --min-success-rate 80 --min-avg-profit 200 --confirm
```

### Selection Presets Explained

When using `refine-best`, you can choose different selection strategies:

- **`--selection-preset conservative`**: Prioritizes consistency and low drawdown
- **`--selection-preset aggressive`**: Focuses on maximum returns
- **`--selection-preset balanced`**: Balances risk and reward (default)
- **`--selection-preset robust`**: Emphasizes cross-validation and overfitting detection
- **`--all-presets`**: Tests all presets to find the ultimate best DNA

### 2. Command Examples

```bash
# Run basic backtests without specific DNAs
jesse-bulk bulk MyStrategy

# Test top 5 DNAs with 3 random time periods each
jesse-bulk refine-best /path/to/study.db --top-n 5 --runs-per-dna 3

# Auto-detect database location (if only one exists)
jesse-bulk refine MyStrategy auto

# Process specific Optuna study
jesse-bulk pick /path/to/optuna_study.db
```

## üìà Example Results

After running `jesse-bulk refine`, you'll get comprehensive CSV results:

```
Strategy: Rainmaker
Total Backtests: 2,500
Execution Time: 1.3 minutes
Best DNA: 734.14% finishing balance
```

The CSV output includes metrics like:
- `total` - Number of trades
- `win_rate` - Winning percentage
- `net_profit_percentage` - Total profit/loss %
- `sharpe_ratio` - Risk-adjusted returns
- `max_drawdown` - Maximum loss period
- And 30+ other detailed metrics

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Filtering

Filter results based on multiple criteria in `bulk_config.yml`:

```yaml
filter_dna:
  training:
    total:
      min: 50        # Minimum trades
    win_rate:
      min: 0.55      # Minimum 55% win rate
    sharpe_ratio:
      min: 1.0       # Minimum Sharpe ratio
    max_drawdown:
      max: 0.2       # Maximum 20% drawdown
```

### Multiple Timeframes and Symbols

```yaml
symbols:
  - "BTC-USDT"
  - "ETH-USDT"
  - "SOL-USDT"
timeframes:
  - "1h"
  - "3h"
  - "4h"
timespans:
  0:
    start_date: "2024-01-01"
    finish_date: "2024-06-30"
  1:
    start_date: "2024-07-01"  
    finish_date: "2024-12-31"
```

This configuration will run backtests for each combination: 3 symbols √ó 2 timeframes √ó 2 timespans = 12 backtests per DNA.

## üèÜ Hall of Fame System

The Hall of Fame is a persistent storage system that tracks your best performing DNAs over time. It solves a common problem: finding DNAs that perform well not just in their optimization period, but consistently across different market conditions.

### How It Works

1. **DNA Storage**: When you run `refine-best`, top performers are automatically added to the Hall of Fame SQLite database (`storage/hall_of_fame.db`)

2. **Performance Testing**: Use `hall-of-fame` command to test stored DNAs across random time periods

3. **Win System**: DNAs earn "wins" based on composite scoring:
   - **50%** - Success Rate (must be ‚â•80% to qualify)
   - **20%** - Average Profit
   - **15%** - Average Sharpe Ratio
   - **10%** - Average Finishing Balance
   - **5%** - Minimum Balance (risk control)

4. **Leaderboard**: Track which DNAs consistently win across different tests

### Why Success Rate Matters Most

The scoring heavily weights success rate (50%) because in real trading:
- A strategy that fails 60% of the time means bankruptcy 6 out of 10 times
- You can't compound gains if you go broke
- Consistency beats home runs

### Hall of Fame Commands

```bash
# View statistics
jesse-bulk hall-of-fame --show-stats

# Test top 10 DNAs with 5 runs each
jesse-bulk hall-of-fame --top-n 10 --runs-per-dna 5

# Export to CSV
jesse-bulk hall-of-fame --export-csv my_hall_of_fame.csv

# View leaderboard
jesse-bulk leaderboard

# Clean up underperformers
jesse-bulk prune-hall-of-fame --min-success-rate 80 --confirm
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "No Optuna database found"**
```bash
# Specify full path to your Optuna database
jesse-bulk refine MyStrategy /full/path/to/storage/temp/optuna/optuna_study.db
```

**‚ùå "IndexError: index -X is out of bounds"**  
‚úÖ **Fixed in latest version!** The tool now correctly calculates warmup candles for all timeframes.

**‚ùå "Strategy not found"**  
Make sure you're in your Jesse project directory and the strategy name matches exactly.

**‚ùå Performance issues**  
Reduce `n_jobs` in config or clear the `storage/bulk` cache directory.

### Getting Help

- Check that you're in a valid Jesse project directory
- Ensure your Optuna optimization has completed successfully  
- Verify your strategy name matches the directory name in `strategies/`
- Make sure `bulk_config.yml` is properly configured
