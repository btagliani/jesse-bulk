# Jesse bulk backtest

`jesse-bulk pick`
Loads a CSV you got from Jesse's optimization. Removes duplicates and filteres it according to your config.

`jesse-bulk refine`
Runs all backtests according to your configuration (symbols, timeframes, start & finish-dates) with the DNAs from the CSV and creates a CSV containing all metrics of the backtests.

`jesse-bulk bulk`
Runs all backtests according to your configuration (symbols, timeframes, start & finish-dates) and creates a CSV containing all metrics of the backtests.

Only works with the dashboard version / branch of jesse.

You will find the results in a csv in your project folder. 

Uses joblib for multiprocessing. Uses pickle cache for candles. You might want to clear `storage/bulk` if you use it a lot and run out of space.

The bulk_config.yml should be self-explainatory.

## Warning
- warm-up-candles are taken from the candles passed. So the actual start_date is different then it would be during a normal backtest.
- extra route candles are added to all backtests - even though they might not be needed by the symbol. 

This could be improved.
